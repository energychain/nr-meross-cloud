Node-RED Node to get Energy Data of  Meross SmartPlug  (like MSS310)

During development of [Corrently Current](https://github.com/energychain/corrently-current) we wanted  to get energy data from smart plugs in. Thats's why this Node exists. It is designed mainly to be used in the embedded environment of a [Corrently Edge](https://github.com/energychain/corrently-edge) Node-RED instance.
